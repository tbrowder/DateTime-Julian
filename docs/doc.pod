DateTime::Julian - Provides routines to use astronomical Julian dates (sometimes called
I<Julian day numbers>)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use DateTime::Julian;
my $jd = nnnn.nnnn; # Julian date for 20
my $utc = DateTime::Julian.new: :juliandate($jd);
say $utc.j2000;
say $utc.jcent;
my $lon = -86.234; # local observer's latitude;
# Get the local sidereal time for the UTC at the current Julian date
my $lst = $utc.lst: :$lon; 

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DateTime::Julian contains a subclass of a DateTime object that
is instantiated from a I<Julian date>.  

Following are some pertinent definitions from Wikipedia topic
I<Julian day>:

=item1 The B<Julian day> is the continous count of the days since 
the beginning of the Julian period, and is used primarily used
by astronomers....

=item1 The B<Julian day number> (JDN) is the integer assigned to
a whole solar day count starting from noon Universal time, with Julian
day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, 4713 BC,
proleptic Julian calendar (November 24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar),
a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: indiction, Solar,
and Lunar cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history. For example,
the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 UT (noon) on January 1, 2000,
was B<2451545>.

=item1 The B<Julian date> (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction 
of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are
expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.
For example, the Julian date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013,
is B<2456293.520833>.
